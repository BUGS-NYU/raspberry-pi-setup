We're very glad you've found yourself a Raspberry Pi and are entering the world of Pi development. 

We started with a Canakit, that can be seen/purchased here: https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-3-starter-kit.html

In the box came:
Raspberry Pi 3 (RPi3) Model B Quad-Core 1.2 GHz 1 GB RAM 
On-board WiFi Connectivity
32 GB MicroSD Card 
Micro USB Power Supply 
Raspberry Pi 3 Case
Premium Quality HDMI Cable 
2 x Heat Sinks

What you will need to get your hands on:
a) A monitor (Preferably one with an HDMI port, else you will need a convertor from HDMI to whatever display port you have on your machine)
b) a usb keyboard (bluetooth works, but the setup is tougher)
c) a usb mouse
d) an outlet
e) wifi access. Optionally: an ethernet cable, ie a hard wired internet connection.


STEPS:

1) To begin, take the Pi itself, and snap it into the black case. This takes considerable force. 
2) Insert the SD card that comes with the set into the Pi.
3) Plug adapter into outlet, HDMI cord into display, mouse and keyboard into the Pi.
4) Turn on the display, and you should see the Pi setup begin with a command prompt to the screen
5) Install Raspian (the OS) as prompted.
6) Now the Pi is set up and ready to go!


Do not format the SD card before hand if you purchase a Canakit! THen you won't have noobs automatically (Noobs is the software that installs the OS) If it a non CanaKit Pi, format the card (a number of free softwares online do this) and then install Noobs. Once Noobs is installed the Pi should work as expected and should prompt the install of Raspian.
