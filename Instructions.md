# Instructions
A Raspberry Pi is a computer that has ports to plug into a computer monitor. It is capable of doing exactly what your normal 
laptop or desktop can do; it's just a lot cuter. We're very glad you've found yourself a Raspberry Pi and are entering the 
world of Pi development. 

We started with a Canakit, that can be seen/purchased here: https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-3-starter-kit.html

### Components
###### In the box came
* Raspberry Pi 3 (RPi3) Model B Quad-Core 1.2 GHz 1 GB RAM 
* On-board WiFi Connectivity
* 32 GB MicroSD Card 
* Micro USB Power Supply 
* Raspberry Pi 3 Case
* Premium Quality HDMI Cable 
* 2 x Heat Sinks

###### What you will need to get your hands on
* A monitor (Preferably one with an HDMI port, otherwise you'll need a convertor from HDMI to whatever display port you have on your machine)
* A USB keyboard (bluetooth works, but the setup is tougher)
* A USB mouse
* An outlet
* WiFi access. Optionally: an ethernet cable, i.e. a hard wired internet connection.


### STEPS
1. To begin, take the Pi itself, and snap it into the black case. This takes considerable force. 
2. Insert the SD card that comes with the set into the Pi.
3. Plug adapter into outlet, HDMI cord into display, mouse and keyboard into the Pi.
4. Turn on the display, and you should see the Pi setup begin with a command prompt to the screen
5. Install Raspian (the OS) as prompted.
6. Now the Pi is set up and ready to go!

A note on formatting the SD Card:

Do not format the SD card before hand if you purchase a Canakit! Then you won't have NOOBS automatically 
(NOOBS is the software that installs the OS). If it a non CanaKit Pi, format the card (a number of free softwares 
online do this). One such software, SD Formatter 4.0  can be downloaded from this website : 
https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/index.html. An SD card is a memory card and it contains rows of 
memory chips that store documents, images, music etc. Memory card formatting is essentially cleaning the SD card 
by removing any data that was previously on it. Formatting memory cards is important because
it maintains the card's full speed performance, preserves its storage capacity and reduces the risk of storage errors. 
Formatting a card is actually different from just deleting and erasing content that is stored. When data is erased from 
the card, the actual data still on the card, but will be overwritten with new data. Formatting a memory card loses 
all of its data irreversibly. 
 
If you've formatted your Pi, then install NOOBS from the RaspberryPi website. Once NOOBS is installed, 
the Pi should work as expected and should prompt you to install of Raspian.
